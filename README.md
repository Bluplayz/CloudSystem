# CloudSystem
Basic CloudSystem with not much special features. Fork it and do whatever you want with that :)

There is no "Download and have Fun" Button, because its currently in development, but you can clone it and test it :D
This should be a simple CloudSystem to start/stop BungeeCord Proxies, Spigot Servers and manage them (Read their consoles, read logs, send commands in their consoles and so on)
but it doesnt manage your whole server network!
